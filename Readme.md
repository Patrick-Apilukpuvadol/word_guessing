Workding on the ideas for the interminal game and the functions to add to the project. 

Game will function basically as hangman where the user will guess the letters until they get the completed word

- Function where program takes user input and verifies if it matches with any letters in the word in the guess. Need to make sure that the letters coinside with the positioning relative to rest of the word. 

- Function to keep track of how many guesses the user has left to be indicated. Want to try add interminal graphics like hang man to make the game more resposive to the user

- Function that keeps a record of the correct and incorrect letter guesses. Correct letter guesses will appear in the mystery word and in the correct positioning in relation to the word. Incorrect guesses must appear on the side list. Will add function that will stop the user from entering duplicate letter guesses so it doesn't waste the user's turns

- Function that will keep the users score of correctly guessed words as a high score

- Function that the program will randomly select from a list of words provided and will display the amount of letters in underscores " _ "
